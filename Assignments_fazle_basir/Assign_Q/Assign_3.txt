You have the two sorted lists of N/2 elements each. Find the median N numbers when two lists are combined. Suggest an  efficient algorithm for solving the problem and give its analysis (Recurrence Relation / Asymptotic notation etc...)
Ã˜For example
List 1 :-  80  85  86  87   100

List 2 :-  2     60  69  70   86

Median is :- 80 and 85
